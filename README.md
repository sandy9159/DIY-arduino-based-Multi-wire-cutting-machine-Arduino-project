Hello friends in this video I have made a Multiple wire cutter machine using arduino.
There are 4 different colors of wires which feed to cutter via a single motor,
for feeding different color feeder motor drive by a stepper motor and shaft mounted gear get of feeder motor engage with the opposite gear to feed respective color of wire.

I have used a 2.8" nextion HMI for the user interface.
user can enter how much quantity and length for wire to cut.

Using HMI is very best idea because this Nextion HMI have on board 
uController on it.
Means all the HMI coding Is stored in HMI itself no extra load on Arduino.
this will make coding simple and fast, HMI itself have some GPIOâ€™s on board

First I take the 12 mm birch plywood sheet and cut it down in 180 x 200 small piece this will became the base

of ou machine, using wood is good idea its easy to drill hole into them at same time they are very strong

I have printed may parts in PLA on my 3D printer 

I have artilliary genius 3D printer all the parts I have printed in 30% infill.

I printed all  my parts in PLA because its easy to get Quality print with minimal care, while ABS prints needs more care

Then I mointed SK8 8mm shaft holder on the wooden sheet

this holder holds 8mm smooth rod on which our motor will be slide
