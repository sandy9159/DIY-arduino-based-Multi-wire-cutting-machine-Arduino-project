Hello friends in this video I have made a Multiple wire cutter machine using arduino.
There are 4 different colors of wires which feed to cutter via a single motor,
for feeding different color feeder motor drive by a stepper motor and shaft mounted gear get of feeder motor engage with the opposite gear to feed respective color of wire.

I have used a 2.8" nextion HMI for the user interface.
user can enter how much quantity and length for wire to cut.

Using HMI is very best idea because this Nextion HMI have on board 
uController on it.
Means all the HMI coding Is stored in HMI itself no extra load on Arduino.
this will make coding simple and fast, HMI itself have some GPIOâ€™s on board
